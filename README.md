# jqueryium-shopping-cart-plain
# Made originally in JQUERY and Bootstrap for AltCademy

on May 12th, 2021 I converted it to use pure Javascript and removed JQUERY and Bootstrap. I chose Bulma to replace Bootstrap based on the following criteria.

1. Siimple framework is far too verbose and not as extensible
2. Foundation framework is very extensible but also requires Jquery
3. Bulma (the framework I chose) uses semantically simple terminology (that is actually even superior to Bootstrap) and does not add any bloated JS libraries. This means you are responsible for implementing the JavaScript to perform dropdowns, hover effects, etc.
